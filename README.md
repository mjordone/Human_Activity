# Human_Activity
Data set transformed from the *Human Activity Recognition* project, and associated files.

This repository consist of three files.

1. humanact_reduced.txt: a data set obtained from the *Human Activity Recognition* project and transformed to aggregate, in one single dataset, the measurements for all the subjects and activities observed in this project. Further, the dataset reduces the multiple observations of each activity in each subject to one observation per activity and subject by averaging the corresponding values.  

2. CodeBook.md: a text document describing the data set and the variables contained in it.

3. run_analysis.R : an R script describing step-by-setp the processes of aggregation, cleaning, and reduction through which the humanact_reduced.csv data set was obtained from the raw data made publicly available by the *Human Activity Recognition* project.
