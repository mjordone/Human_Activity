The data set *humanact_reduced.txt* contains an aggregated and reduced version of the data sets provided by the *Human Activity Recognition* project. As the researchers describe it, the experiments in this project were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

The *humanact_reduced.txt* data set aggregates the data from the *test group* and the *train group* for each of the six activities. The original data sets contained more than one measurment per subject and activity. The *humanact_reduced.txt* data set reduces this information by reporting the average measurment per subject and activity. 

All the  variables in the dataset and the information about them were obtained from the *Human Activity Recognition database*. A full description of the project and the raw data set can be obtained at:

Identification Variables 
========================

Two variables are considered *identification variables*:

- subject: identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
- activities: a factor identifying the type of activity observed. Its range is from 1 to 6, and their values are: 
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

Feature Variables 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 'time' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyAcc-XYZ and timeGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccJerk-XYZ and timeBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccMag, timeGravityAccMag, timeBodyAccJerkMag, timeBodyGyroMag, timeBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing freqBodyAcc-XYZ, freqBodyAccJerk-XYZ, freqBodyGyro-XYZ, freqBodyAccJerkMag, freqBodyGyroMag, freqBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'freq' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

timeBodyAcc-XYZ
timeGravityAcc-XYZ
timeBodyAccJerk-XYZ
timeBodyGyro-XYZ
timeBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
timeBodyAccMag
timeGravityAccMag
timeBodyAccJerkMag
timeBodyGyroMag
timeBodyGyroJerkMag
freqBodyAcc-XYZ
freqBodyAccJerk-XYZ
freqBodyGyro-XYZ
freqBodyAccMag
freqBodyAccJerkMag
freqBodyGyroMag
freqBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation
meanFreq: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the 'angle' variable:

gravityMean
timeBodyAccMean
timeBodyAccJerkMean
timeBodyGyroMean
timeBodyGyroJerkMean
